# AI
Here are my differents AI programs in C++ which implement and solve differents games like the minesweeper game, the sliding puzzle, sudoku, tic tac toe and the game of life

## Minesweeper
  I implemented the minesweeper, you have the choice to play the game or let the AI play by changing the value of the constant AI (line 10 from DÃ©mineur.cpp) to 1. If you want to play you can reveal a case with a left click and you can flag with a right click. The game is a 30x30 square randomly generated with 15% of bombs.

### Implementation of the AI : 
At first i wanted to implement dpll algorithm in order to solve all the solvable minsweeper but I decided to just implement an AI using 2 simple rules and see its efficency:
For each revealed case wich has unrevealed neighbors the AI count the number of unknown bombs and the number of unreveal neighbors (function KparmiN).

 - First rule

If there are as many unknown bombs as the number of unrevealed case, we can flag all the unrevealed neighbors. In the case there is 1 bomb for 1 unknown case so we can flag this case.

  - Second rule

  If there is 0 unknown bomb for n unrevealed cases, we can reveal them all. In this case the square in the middle tells us there are 2 bombs but there is 0 unknown bomb (2 cases flaged) so we can reveal all the unknown cases.
