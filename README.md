# AI
Here are my differents AI programs in C++ which implement and solve differents games like the minesweeper game, the sliding puzzle, sudoku, tic tac toe and the game of life

### Minesweeper
I implemented the minesweeper, you have the choice to play the game or let the AI play by changing the value of the constant AI (line 10 from DÃ©mineur.cpp) to 1. If you want to play you can reveal a case with a left click and you can flag with a right click. The game is a 30x30 square randomly generated with 15% of bombs.
